            <h3>My Life</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              <p>
                As much as I hate the snow, I've lived in Wisconsin most of my
                life. My family moved here in 2000, and have been here since. Throughout my
                 youth, I've always been a creative. I even built my very first
                game while in a middle school summer program. It was so bad, but definitely
                worth it. From there, I was curious about how art met code. I proceeded to submit 
                art frequently at school shows. Always sketching something. Always carrying my sketchpad.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Once I started taking Graphic Design courses in High School, I knew I
                was going to have a career in conveying art with technology. I
                was fascinated. I even joined the U.S. Army Reserves to pay for art school
                in Chicago. Ultimately, that didn't happen. As a soldier, I was
                introduced to the tech field trained as a Signal Support Operations
                Specialist. This allowed me to spend a few years soaking up how
                tactical communication systems operate in an enterprise.
                It was fun, but to me, it wasn't always fulfilling.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                At that point, I felt pulled away from what I truly wanted to do. I saw two issues before me. 
                I stopped being creative and I wasn't really motivated in my field. Things changed when I
                saw how rapidly software developers were making a lifestyle by being creative. I wanted in.
                So, I enrolled in a dev bootcamp (Bottega University), and used my downtime to immerse myself.
                I fell in love with building what you see on any device, the front-end, and that's where art met code for me again.
                Now, as I look to the future, I'm looking to grow a tech agency, sell my
                NFT art, and teach what I know to those getting started.

              <p>
                I seek to explore entrepreneurial opportunities within development.
                 Whether it's building web or mobile app templates and selling them 
                 or building my web agency, it's the best way to put me in early retirement. 
                 I also welcome opportunities as a <strong class="hobby-link">Web Designer | Frontend Developer</strong> on contract or direct hire.
