            <h3>My Life</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              <p>
                As much as I hate the snow, I've lived in Wisconsin most of my
                life. My family moved here in 1998', and have been here since. Throughout my
                 youth, Ive always been a creative. I even built my very first
                game while in a middle school summer program. It was so bad but
                worth it. This sparked my interest. Then, I proceeded to submit art frequently at school competitions.
                Always sketching something. Always carrying my sketchpad.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Once I started taking Graphic Design in High School, I knew I
                was going to have a career in conveying art with technology. I
                was fascinated. I even joined the Reserves to pay for art school
                in Chicago. That didn't happen, but along the way, I was
                introduced to the tech field as a Signal Support Operations
                Specialist. This allowed me to spend a few years soaking up what
                tactical communications can do and configuring systems that run
                them. It was fun, but to me, it wasnt always fulfilling.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                I saw two issues before me. I stopped drawing and I wasn't
                really motivated in my job. I saw how rapidly developers were
                making a lifestyle by being creative and I wanted in! So while
                on deployment, I continued a full stack developer course I was
                taking prior to leaving and really hunkered down to learn how to
                build things. That was it. I finally felt like I could do build
                cool looking solutions, and make hella money doing it. Now, as I
                look to the future, I'm looking to grow a tech agency, sell my
                NFT art, and teach what I know to those getting started.

              <p>
                I seek to explore entrepreneurial opportunities within development.
                 Whether it's building web or mobile app templates and selling them 
                 or building my web agency, it's the best way to put me in early retirement. 
                 I also welcome opportunities as a <strong class="hobby-link">Web Designer | Frontend Developer</strong> on contract or direct hire.
