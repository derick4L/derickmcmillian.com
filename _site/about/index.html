            <h3>My Life</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              <p>
                Born and raised in Kenosha, Wisconsin, I've always been a creative. Growing up, I participated in art competitions and even summer programs making simple games. Like most young boys my age (and to this day), I was obsessed with anime, video games and sports. As I got older, tech became yet another love for me as I saw how <span class="italic">enjoyable</span> it made life. Now, I found that building web based applications was a happy medium between art and technology.
