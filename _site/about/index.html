            <h3>My Life</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              <p>
                Throughout my youth, I've always been creative. In High School, Art classes are where I excelled and yet I still had an itch to immerse myself in technology.
                After joining the U.S. Army at 17 years old, I was introduced to the IT realm by configuring and maintaining communications systems. 
                This allowed me to gain a foundational knowledge of how data and systems interact with each other.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p> 
                I grew interest in software development because of the 'work-from-home' lifestyle, the lucrative salaries, the freedom and I wanted in!
                Since enrolling at Bottega University's Full Stack Program, I've built at least 5 web applications with various technology stacks centered around HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                I can say I've found my happy middle ground, where art meets code.

            <h3>Career Goals</h3>
            <div class="paragraph">
              <p>
                I welcome opportunities as a <strong class="hobby-link">Frontend Developer</strong> or <strong class="hobby-link">Full Stack Engineer</strong>.
                I seek to build apps that will change lives, add value to society and hopefully retire me early. I want to be both creator and asset as I grow. 
                I'd love to mentor junior developers and help find their footing.
